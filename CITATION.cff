abstract: >
  We design a method to control the motion of a manipulator
  robot while strictly enforcing collision avoidance in a
  dynamic obstacle field. We rely on model predictive
  control while formulating collision avoidance as a hard
  constraint. We express the constraint as the requirement
  for a signed distance function to be positive between
  pairs of strictly convex objects. Among various
  formulations, we provide a suitable definition for this
  signed distance and for the analytical derivatives needed
  by the numerical solver to enforce the constraint. The
  method is completely implemented on a manipulator "Panda"
  robot, and the efficient open-source implementation is
  provided along with the paper. We experimentally
  demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by performing
  dynamic tasks in an obstacle field while reacting to
  non-modeled perturbations.
